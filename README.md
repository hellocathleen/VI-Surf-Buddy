# Point Break - a Vancouver Island surfer's guide to great surfing
Point Break is all about getting you the info you need in order to enjoy the best of Vancouver Island surfing. Point Break offers user registration, where a user may select up to 10 of their favorite Vancouver Island beaches. Users will then receive notifications via email or text, depending on their preference, telling them when the weather conditions are just right for a great day of surfing. 

Point Break's back-end server is responsible for updating surf weather information, interacting with the database, and sending notifications to users.
